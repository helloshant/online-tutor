# TutorOps — Online Tutor SaaS

A chatops-style tutoring platform. Students subscribe to a board, grade, medium, and a set of
subjects; pay via Razorpay; then chat with an LLM tutor that stays confined to the subscribed
subject and that grade/board's syllabus, always answering in the chosen language. Admins get a
panel to see every user's selections and manage the underlying board/grade/subject/syllabus
catalog.

Built with Next.js (App Router), Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Row Level Security), Razorpay, and
a pluggable LLM backend (Anthropic Claude by default, or Azure OpenAI).

## How it works

1. **Sign up** — email/password via Supabase Auth (`/signup`, `/login`).
2. **Onboarding** (`/onboarding`) — pick a board (e.g. CBSE, ICSE, West Bengal Board), a grade,
   the subjects offered for that board+grade, and a medium of instruction (English / Hindi /
   Bengali). This creates a `pending_payment` subscription.
3. **Payment** (`/subscribe`) — Razorpay Checkout. On success the payment signature is verified
   server-side and the subscription is flipped to `active`.
4. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — left panel lists the subscribed subjects; selecting one scopes
   the right-hand chat panel to that subject. Every message is answered by Claude, constrained by
   a system prompt built from the syllabus topics stored for that board/grade/subject, in the
   subscribed medium.
5. **Admin panel** (`/admin`) — lists every user with their board/grade/medium/subjects/status and
   lets an admin promote/demote admins and cancel subscriptions. `/admin/catalog` manages boards,
   grades, subjects, which subjects each board/grade offers, and the syllabus topics themselves.

## Data model & security

See `supabase/migrations/` for the full schema:

- `0001_init_schema.sql` — `profiles`, `boards`, `grades`, `subjects`, `board_grade_subjects`,
  `syllabus_topics`, `subscriptions`, `subscription_subjects`, `chat_messages`.
- `0002_rls_policies.sql` — Row Level Security. Users can only read their own profile,
  subscriptions, and chat history; the catalog tables are readable by any signed-in user and
  writable only by admins (`profiles.role = 'admin'`). Subscription **activation** and all
  **chat message writes** happen only from trusted server code using the Supabase service-role
  key, never directly from the browser — this is what stops a user from marking their own
  subscription paid or forging an assistant reply.
- `0003_seed_catalog.sql` — CBSE / ICSE / West Bengal Board, Grades 6–12, and the six subjects
  (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, Geography), with a representative sample
  syllabus for Grade 9 (all subjects, all three boards) and Grade 10 (Math/Physics/Chemistry/
  Biology) to demonstrate that Q&A scoping genuinely differs per board. **This sample syllabus is
  illustrative, not an authoritative reproduction of any board's official syllabus** — extend and
  correct it via `/admin/catalog` for every grade/board/subject you actually offer before going
  to production.

## Local setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create a Supabase project

Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (or run one locally with the Supabase
CLI), then run the migrations against it, in order:

```bash
# via the Supabase CLI, from the project root
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
supabase db push
```

(Or paste the contents of each file in `supabase/migrations/`, in numeric order, into the
Supabase SQL editor.)

### 3. Promote yourself to admin

Sign up through the app once, then in the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
update public.profiles set role = 'admin' where id = '<your-auth-user-id>';
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` —
  Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → API.
- `LLM_PROVIDER` — `anthropic` (default) or `azure-openai`. Only fill in the section for
  whichever one you pick:
  - **Anthropic**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
    `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` is optional and defaults to Anthropic's current flagship model.
  - **Azure OpenAI**: `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` from your Azure OpenAI
    resource's Keys and Endpoint page, `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT` (the deployment name you
    gave the model in Azure AI Foundry, e.g. `gpt-4o`), and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` (e.g.
    `2024-08-01-preview`).
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` — Razorpay dashboard → Settings → API Keys. Use test
  mode keys for local development.

### 5. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Pricing

Pricing is subject-count based (`PRICE_PER_SUBJECT_INR` in `src/lib/pricing.ts`) and computed
server-side when a subscription is created — the client never supplies the amount charged.

## Notes for going to production

- Replace/extend the seeded sample syllabus with the real, complete syllabus for every board and
  grade you offer, via `/admin/catalog`.
- Set up Razorpay webhooks if you want to handle payment failures/refunds beyond the
  checkout-success flow already implemented in `src/app/api/razorpay/verify/route.ts`.
- Configure Supabase Auth email templates / SMTP for production-grade signup emails.
